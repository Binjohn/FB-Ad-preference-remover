# FB-Ad-preference-remover
Script to remove all ad preferences on facebook

## How to run
1. Log into Facebook on Google Chrome on a desktop
2. Go to Settings - > Ads -> Ads Based on my preferences -> Manage preferences
3. On the preferences page, expand all the categories. I was unable to automate this.
4. Press F12 on a Windows or Cmd+Shift+I on a Mac
5. This opens the developer console. On the top, you'll find a console tab. Click that
6. You'll see a STOP warning from Facebook here. Ignore that, we are just automating what you'd otherwise have to do by clicking about 350 times
7. Copy paste the code from the fbapr-min.js file into the console tab.
8. Sit back and watch hundreds of ad categories being removed!
